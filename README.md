Hello! I'm Rakesh Chourasia, a B.Tech student at Sree Dattha Institutions and an aspiring data analyst. This repository features my projects in data analysis, where I utilize Python and Power BI to extract insights and predict outcomes.

Projects Overview
Consumer Data Analysis
I have worked on analyzing consumer data from a grocery shop to identify trends and improve business decisions. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating visualizations to understand consumer behavior.

Olympic Medal Prediction
In another project, I focused on predicting Olympic medal counts using linear regression in Python. This involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to provide accurate predictions.
